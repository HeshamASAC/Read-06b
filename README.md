Everywhere computers are changing the world.

Whether they're on desktops, or in our pockets, or just about anywhere else.
 
 
 How computers work?
 
 A computer's processor takes information from memory,It manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm,which is just a series of commands.
 And then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again.
 This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.
 
 
 How a computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do?
 
 A computer display can show text, photos, videos, or interactive games even virtual reality!
 The output of a computer may even include signals to control a robot.
And, when computers connect over the Internet, the output from one computer becomes the input to another, and vice versa.



How do you store or represent information using electricity?
Well, if we have a single wire with electricity flowing through it,the signal could either be on or off.
With one wire, we can represent a yes or no, true or false, a one or zero,



binary number system.
In the decimal number system, we have ten digits from zero to nine, and we only have two digits: zero and one.
With these two digits, we can count
up to any number.



In order to process the information that comes in as input, and to make the information that is output,
a computer needs to modify and combine the input signals.
To do this, a computer uses millions of teeny electronic components, which come together to form circuits.



Computers can take many different types of input, like the keyboard of a computer, the touchpad of a phone,
When you press a key on your keyboard - let's say the letter "B". The keyboard converts the letter to a number.
That number is sent as binary, ones and zeros, into the computer.
Starting from this number, the CPU calculates how to display the letter "B" pixel by pixel.
The CPU requests step-by-step instructions from memory, which tell it how to draw the letter "B".
The CPU runs these instructions and stores the results as pixels in memory.
Finally, this pixel information is sent in binary to the screen.



How Computers Work: Hardware and Software
When we look inside a computing device you see a bunch of circuits, chips, wires. This is the hardware.
But what you don't see is the software. Software is all of the computer programs, or code, running on this machine.
But we need the hardware and the software interact with one another
